# Tequila_Mockingbird
Project 2 API call using React

# Description

This website is going to be using an API call using React to pull and display information from (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php). You will be able to search cocktails by name or browse by alcohol type, ingredient type, and Drink type including Mocktails!

The purpose of this website is to help those wishing to explore different drinks and expand their palate. In the image below you can see a general layout of how the home page, drink display page, and drink details page will look along with a link to the relevant wireframes and component hierarchy diagram.
